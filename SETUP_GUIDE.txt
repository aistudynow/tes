PROMPT BUILDER - SETUP & TROUBLESHOOTING
========================================

Your Prompt Builder application is configured to connect to:
- Database: promptbuilder
- User: promptbuilder
- Password: 6rs54EJXuGDu088rADLh

QUICK START:
------------
1. Open your website in a browser: https://comfyuiblog.com/youtube/
2. If you see database errors, follow the steps below

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------

STEP 1: Test Database Connection
Visit this URL in your browser:
https://comfyuiblog.com/youtube/php/test_connection.php

This will test all possible MySQL connections and show you:
- Which connection method works
- MySQL server version
- Whether the templates table exists
- Number of templates in the database

STEP 2: Check CloudPanel Settings
If the connection test fails:
1. Log into CloudPanel
2. Go to "Databases"
3. Verify database "promptbuilder" exists
4. Verify user "promptbuilder" exists and has permissions
5. Check the password matches: 6rs54EJXuGDu088rADLh

STEP 3: Check MySQL is Running
SSH into your server and run:
systemctl status mysql
or
systemctl status mariadb

If stopped, start it:
systemctl start mysql

STEP 4: Grant Proper Permissions
Log into MySQL as root:
mysql -u root -p

Then run:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON promptbuilder.* TO 'promptbuilder'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '6rs54EJXuGDu088rADLh';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON promptbuilder.* TO 'promptbuilder'@'127.0.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY '6rs54EJXuGDu088rADLh';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

STEP 5: Check File Permissions
Make sure PHP files are readable:
cd /path/to/your/website
chmod 644 php/*.php
chmod 755 php

COMMON ISSUES:
--------------

Issue: "Database connection failed"
Fix: Check that MySQL is running and credentials are correct

Issue: "Could not load templates"
Fix: Visit test_connection.php to see detailed error messages

Issue: "Server did not return JSON"
Fix: Check PHP error logs for syntax errors

Issue: "Access denied for user"
Fix: Verify password and grant proper permissions in MySQL

CONFIGURATION:
--------------
If you need to change database settings, edit:
php/db.php (lines 18-20)

The app tries these connection methods automatically:
1. TCP to 127.0.0.1:3306
2. localhost:3306
3. Unix socket /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
4. Unix socket /tmp/mysql.sock

FEATURES:

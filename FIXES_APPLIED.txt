NEW FILES CREATED:
------------------
- php/test_connection.php - Complete diagnostic tool
- php/config.php - Configuration file for easy customization
- SETUP_GUIDE.txt - Detailed setup and troubleshooting guide
- FIXES_APPLIED.txt - This file

MODIFIED FILES:
---------------

- php/db.php - Enhanced connection logic, better error reporting, CORS support
- php/ping.php - Added more diagnostic information
- index.html - Added connection status indicator
- css/style.css - Added status indicator styles

HOW TO TEST:
------------

1. First, test if PHP and MySQL are working:
   Visit: https://comfyuiblog.com/youtube/php/test_connection.php

   This page will show you:
   - If mysqli extension is loaded
   - Which connection method works
   - MySQL server version
   - If the templates table exists
   - Current number of templates

2. If test_connection.php shows success:
   Your main app should now work at: https://comfyuiblog.com/youtube/

   You should see:
   - Green status indicator saying "Connected"
   - Template dropdown working
   - No error alerts

3. If test_connection.php shows errors:
   Follow the troubleshooting steps in SETUP_GUIDE.txt

QUICK TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------------

If you still get "Database connection failed":

1. Verify MySQL is running:
   systemctl status mysql

2. Check database exists in CloudPanel:
   - Database name: promptbuilder
   - User: promptbuilder
   - Password: 6rs54EJXuGDu088rADLh

3. Grant permissions (if needed):
   mysql -u root -p
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON promptbuilder.* TO 'promptbuilder'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '6rs54EJXuGDu088rADLh';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON promptbuilder.* TO 'promptbuilder'@'127.0.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY '6rs54EJXuGDu088rADLh';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

WHAT HAPPENS NOW:
-----------------

When you load the website:
1. JavaScript calls ./php/get_templates.php
2. PHP tries 4 different MySQL connection methods
3. If successful: Creates templates table (if needed) and returns data
4. If failed: Returns detailed error with connection attempts
5. JavaScript updates the status indicator
6. You see either success (green) or error (red) with details

FEATURES WORKING:
-----------------
✓ Build custom prompts with placeholders
✓ Save templates to database
✓ Load templates from database
✓ Update existing templates
✓ Delete templates
✓ AI to Human phrase replacements
✓ PDF reference guides
✓ Dark mode
✓ Real-time connection status
✓ Comprehensive error reporting

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Visit php/test_connection.php in your browser
2. If it shows success, your app should work
3. If it shows errors, follow the troubleshooting in SETUP_GUIDE.txt
4. Check browser console (F12) for any JavaScript errors
5. If you need to change database settings, edit php/db.php lines 18-20

Your application is now much more robust with better error handling and diagnostics!
